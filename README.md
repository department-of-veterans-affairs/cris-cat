# CRIS-CAT

This repository is the new home for the CRIS-CAT (Computer Adaptive Test version of the Community Reintegration Scale) software. The artifact you see here is for download only and is maintained by the research.va.gov team.

Artifacts are located in releases - [click here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/cris-cat/releases).

Directions for running the application are as follows: 
1. The link will open a new web page, download the "Source Code (zip.file)" (This will download a zip folder to your computer). 
1. Extract the folder on your computer by right clicking on the zip folder and choosing "extract". 
1. After the folder has been extracted, click on the unzipped folder (with the same name) and choose the CRIS CAT 1.17 folder. 
1. Finally, choose the CAT_2 application to run the CRIS-CAT program.

The CRIS-CAT is a computer adaptive test (CAT) version of the Community Integration of Injured Service Members (CRIS) measure.  The CRIS-CAT  allows accurate and precise measurement of Veteran community reintegration with minimal respondent burden.  It is suitable for use in clinical care and research. The CRIS-CAT and its software were developed through VA research funding and are freely available through this website.
The CRIS-CAT is comprised of separate scales, each measuring a different aspect of community reintegration: frequency of participation, perceived limitations in participation and satisfaction with participation.  These scales can be utilized singly or in combination, chosen to best match the purpose of data collection.  
The CRIS-CAT can be self-administered and contains an audio feature that reads each item out loud.  The CAT algorithm automatically selects items to maximize precision of scoring and outputs the final scores at the end of administration.  This software does not save scores; users must record the scores after completion.
